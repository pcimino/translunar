      <p>Founded in 1996, Trans Lunar Designs Incorporated started out as a simple software development contracting firm. Most of our work was, and continues to be, in the Retail Financial services industry. Other clients have been in sectors such as pharamceutical, healthcare marketing and medical publications.</p>
      <p>In 2000 we started working with small clients and providing full services from business consulting to delivering full stack IT solutions and e-commerce sites. Relationships with <b>Instant Money Order</b> and <b>Pick A Pony</b> were quickly followed by Sanofi-Aventis, Vertex Tax Solutions and JTE Multimedia.</p>
      <p>In 2007 Agile experience became integral with our solution offerings and can now have a certified Scrum Master on staff.</p>
      <p>Today Trans Lunar Designs continues in the tradition of boutique firms, providing software architecture, software development and IT management consulting services.</p>
